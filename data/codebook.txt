1. Observational Data Variables ('df_scaled')
-------------------------------------------------

Variable Name:        A
Description:          Participant's age.
Role in IV Analysis:  Instrumental Variable (Z)
Operationalisation:   Self-reported age in years.

---

Variable Name:        V
Description:          General attitude of scepticism towards vaccines.
Role in IV Analysis:  Endogenous Predictor (D)
Operationalisation:   Mean score from the 10-item Attitude and Belief in Vaccination Scale (ABVS). Pro-vaccine items were reverse-scored so higher scores consistently indicate greater scepticism.

---

Variable Name:        C
Description:          Endorsement of anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.
Role in IV Analysis:  Outcome Variable (Y)
Operationalisation:   Mean score from the 7-item Vaccine Conspiracy Beliefs Scale (VBS).


-------------------------------------------------
2. Simulated Data Variables ('sim_express_scaled' & 'sim_true_scaled')
-------------------------------------------------

These variables were generated in R to test the performance of the IV methodology under known causal structures.

Variable Name:        age
Description:          A simulated variable acting as the instrument.
Role in IV Analysis:  Instrumental Variable (Z)
Operationalisation:   Generated from a normal distribution to act as the exogenous source of variation.

---

Variable Name:        scept
Description:          A simulated variable representing vaccine scepticism.
Role in IV Analysis:  Endogenous Predictor (D)
Operationalisation:   Generated as a function of simulated 'age' (in both models) and simulated 'con' (in the 'True Belief' model only).

---

Variable Name:        con
Description:          A simulated variable representing conspiracy belief.
Role in IV Analysis:  Outcome Variable (Y)
Operationalisation:   Generated as a function of simulated 'scept' (in the 'Expressive Responding' model only) or as an independent variable (in the 'True Belief' model).
